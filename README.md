# SQL_Python
Repository to work with SQL in Python

1) Counting emails into a database
The required files are mbox.txt and sqldb.py.
Both files need to be in the same directory. When mbox.txt is called after executing the Python script, it will loop through all the lines from mbox.txt and it will only process those starting with 'From: '. It will take the domain from the email address and will update or populate a database with the corresponding SQL commands.
